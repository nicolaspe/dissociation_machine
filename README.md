How do machines respond to our democratic right of freedom of association?

Via a ceiling mounted webcam, a machine will observe the movement of the audience. Using a neural network, it will analyze their movement patterns, speed and current congregation to decide if they see us as a collaborator or a threat. This will be reflected by neural-generated patterns projected on top of the same audience.

## Disclaimer
I will not upload any material until I generate some new datasets and polish the code, as the first experiments are run on personal data.
